/*
Package fetcher is for new block body/hash broadcast msg handling.

When a new block Validation msg is generated by a validator, it will be multicasted to all
peers of the validator.

There are two kinds of Validation msg, one is the NewBlockMsg, and another
is NewBlockHashesMsg.

When received a NewBlockMsg, handleSyncMsg in ProtocolManager will enqueue
the msg to pm.fether.

When received a NewBlockHashesMsg, handleSyncMsg in ProtocolManager will notify
pm.fether to fetch the new available block.
